Donut Shoppe pseudocode 

User chooses a selection from the donut and coffee option

The subtotal is calculated from the sum of donut and coffee selected in the SubTotalCalc
Sub Procedure and displays through the lblSubTotalOut.Text and the calc is stored in
decSubtotal

The sales tax is then calculated from tax = .06 times the subtotal which is a parameter
for the SalesTaxCalc function and the calc is stored in decSalesTax.

Then the Sales Tax and Subtotal are passed to the decTotal variable which displays through
the lblTotalDueOut.Text.

When any donut or coffee selection is changed, ClearLabel Sub Procedure activates and clears
all output labels.
